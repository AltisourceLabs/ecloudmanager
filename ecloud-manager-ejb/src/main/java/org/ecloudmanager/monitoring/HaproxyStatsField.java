public enum HaproxyStatsField {
/*
  0. pxname [LFBS]: proxy name
  1. svname [LFBS]: service name (FRONTEND for frontend, BACKEND for backend,
     any name for server/listener)
  2. qcur [..BS]: current queued requests. For the backend this reports the
     number queued without a server assigned.
  3. qmax [..BS]: max value of qcur
  4. scur [LFBS]: current sessions
  5. smax [LFBS]: max sessions
  6. slim [LFBS]: configured session limit
  7. stot [LFBS]: cumulative number of connections
  8. bin [LFBS]: bytes in
  9. bout [LFBS]: bytes out
 10. dreq [LFB.]: requests denied because of security concerns.
     - For tcp this is because of a matched tcp-request content rule.
     - For http this is because of a matched http-request or tarpit rule.
 11. dresp [LFBS]: responses denied because of security concerns.
     - For http this is because of a matched http-request rule, or
       "option checkcache".
 12. ereq [LF..]: request errors. Some of the possible causes are:
     - early termination from the client, before the request has been sent.
     - read error from the client
     - client timeout
     - client closed connection
     - various bad requests from the client.
     - request was tarpitted.
 13. econ [..BS]: number of requests that encountered an error trying to
     connect to a backend server. The backend stat is the sum of the stat
     for all servers of that backend, plus any connection errors not
     associated with a particular server (such as the backend having no
     active servers).
 14. eresp [..BS]: response errors. srv_abrt will be counted here also.
     Some other errors are:
     - write error on the client socket (won't be counted for the server stat)
     - failure applying filters to the response.
 15. wretr [..BS]: number of times a connection to a server was retried.
 16. wredis [..BS]: number of times a request was redispatched to another
     server. The server value counts the number of times that server was
     switched away from.
 17. status [LFBS]: status (UP/DOWN/NOLB/MAINT/MAINT(via)...)
 18. weight [..BS]: total weight (backend), server weight (server)
 19. act [..BS]: number of active servers (backend), server is active (server)
 20. bck [..BS]: number of backup servers (backend), server is backup (server)
 21. chkfail [...S]: number of failed checks. (Only counts checks failed when
     the server is up.)
 22. chkdown [..BS]: number of UP->DOWN transitions. The backend counter counts
     transitions to the whole backend being down, rather than the sum of the
     counters for each server.
 23. lastchg [..BS]: number of seconds since the last UP<->DOWN transition
 24. downtime [..BS]: total downtime (in seconds). The value for the backend
     is the downtime for the whole backend, not the sum of the server downtime.
 25. qlimit [...S]: configured maxqueue for the server, or nothing in the
     value is 0 (default, meaning no limit)
 26. pid [LFBS]: process id (0 for first instance, 1 for second, ...)
 27. iid [LFBS]: unique proxy id
 28. sid [L..S]: server id (unique inside a proxy)
 29. throttle [...S]: current throttle percentage for the server, when
     slowstart is active, or no value if not in slowstart.
 30. lbtot [..BS]: total number of times a server was selected, either for new
     sessions, or when re-dispatching. The server counter is the number
     of times that server was selected.
 31. tracked [...S]: id of proxy/server if tracking is enabled.
 32. type [LFBS]: (0=frontend, 1=backend, 2=server, 3=socket/listener)
 33. rate [.FBS]: number of sessions per second over last elapsed second
 34. rate_lim [.F..]: configured limit on new sessions per second
 35. rate_max [.FBS]: max number of new sessions per second
 36. check_status [...S]: status of last health check, one of:
        UNK     -> unknown
        INI     -> initializing
        SOCKERR -> socket error
        L4OK    -> check passed on layer 4, no upper layers testing enabled
        L4TOUT  -> layer 1-4 timeout
        L4CON   -> layer 1-4 connection problem, for example
                   "Connection refused" (tcp rst) or "No route to host" (icmp)
        L6OK    -> check passed on layer 6
        L6TOUT  -> layer 6 (SSL) timeout
        L6RSP   -> layer 6 invalid response - protocol error
        L7OK    -> check passed on layer 7
        L7OKC   -> check conditionally passed on layer 7, for example 404 with
                   disable-on-404
        L7TOUT  -> layer 7 (HTTP/SMTP) timeout
        L7RSP   -> layer 7 invalid response - protocol error
        L7STS   -> layer 7 response error, for example HTTP 5xx
 37. check_code [...S]: layer5-7 code, if available
 38. check_duration [...S]: time in ms took to finish last health check
 39. hrsp_1xx [.FBS]: http responses with 1xx code
 40. hrsp_2xx [.FBS]: http responses with 2xx code
 41. hrsp_3xx [.FBS]: http responses with 3xx code
 42. hrsp_4xx [.FBS]: http responses with 4xx code
 43. hrsp_5xx [.FBS]: http responses with 5xx code
 44. hrsp_other [.FBS]: http responses with other codes (protocol error)
 45. hanafail [...S]: failed health checks details
 46. req_rate [.F..]: HTTP requests per second over last elapsed second
 47. req_rate_max [.F..]: max number of HTTP requests per second observed
 48. req_tot [.F..]: total number of HTTP requests received
 49. cli_abrt [..BS]: number of data transfers aborted by the client
 50. srv_abrt [..BS]: number of data transfers aborted by the server
     (inc. in eresp)
 51. comp_in [.FB.]: number of HTTP response bytes fed to the compressor
 52. comp_out [.FB.]: number of HTTP response bytes emitted by the compressor
 53. comp_byp [.FB.]: number of bytes that bypassed the HTTP compressor
     (CPU/BW limit)
 54. comp_rsp [.FB.]: number of HTTP responses that were compressed
 55. lastsess [..BS]: number of seconds since last session assigned to
     server/backend
 56. last_chk [...S]: last health check contents or textual error
 57. last_agt [...S]: last agent check contents or textual error
 58. qtime [..BS]: the average queue time in ms over the 1024 last requests
 59. ctime [..BS]: the average connect time in ms over the 1024 last requests
 60. rtime [..BS]: the average response time in ms over the 1024 last requests
     (0 for TCP)
 61. ttime [..BS]: the average total session time in ms over the 1024 last
     requests
