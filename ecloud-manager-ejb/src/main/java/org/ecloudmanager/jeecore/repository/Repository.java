/**
 * Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally defined by
 * Domain-Driven Design (Evans, 2003) as "a mechanism for encapsulating storage,
 * retrieval, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects".
 * <p/>
 * <p>Teams implementing traditional JEE patterns such as "Data Access Object"
 * may also apply this stereotype to DAO classes, though care should be taken to
 * understand the distinction between Data Access Object and DDD-style repositories
 * before doing so. This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and individual teams
 * may narrow their semantics and use as appropriate.
